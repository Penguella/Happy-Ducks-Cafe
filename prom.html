        <!--This page will display the progress bar for monthly promotions, which can be unlocked by buying items worth a certain value during a
    specific timeframe.Since we have no real record of our user's order history, what you see now is a test build-->

            <h1 id="men">How do promotions work and why you need an account? </h1>
            <h2 id="tt">The reason you need an account is to be able to track your progress towards the goal - as well for us to make sure 
                there are no mistakes when it comes to calculating the score- . For every 5 lei spent on our products you receive a point. 
                Collect at least 20 points and you'll receive a plushie of our duck mascot. An event usually lasts 1 month and
                since you can team up with friends ( this is where the reservation via account comes handy) there should be no problem reaching the goal.
            </h2>
            <h1 id="men">Can you save progress from last event? </h1>
            <h2 id="tt"> No. Sadly, the progress bar will be reset at the end of the event.</h2>
            <h1 id="men">How will I see my progress? </h1>
            <h2 id="tt"> We'll update the page to show a progress bar and, once we have a database, you'll be able to see it right here </h2>
            <h1 id="men">When does the 1st event start? </h1>
            <h2 id="tt"> 20th March 2022. You will get nottified on mail.</h2>
